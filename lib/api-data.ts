Add a description of why the parts are hard to translate: e.g. play with words, language or culture specific references, etc. The output should be in English and concise. No need for full sentences. The target audience of this function's output is professional translators, so terminology specific to linguistics and translation studies can be used. Return each phrase only once. Return only the phrases that are hard, not entire sentences, unless the entire sentence is hard to translate. Don't attempt to translate the phrase. Explain why it's hard, and what makes it hard to translate. Include possible pitfalls for machine translation systems if applicable`;
